During the time the story takes place, America was not a place of fairness and opportunity . It wasn't a place of fairness and opportunity because they had discrimination and racism. Another reason it that poor people were not treated as well as the wealthy. Mexicans were not treated right just because they are Mexican.

America was not a place of fairness and opportunity because Mexicans were discriminated against because of their race. For instance in "Asparagus" it says, "Isabel will certainly not be queen no matter how badly she wants it because she is Mexican. You cannot work on engines because you are Mexican."This shows that Mexicans were not treated fairly. According to "I, Too" it says, "They send me to eat in the kitchen when company comes," This explains that just because of their race, they are suddenly less than other people. Apparently if you are poor you 're less than others too.

America was also not a place of fairness and opportunity because you were also discriminated against if you were poor. I know this because "Justice in Eatonville" says," His mama's family were poor sharecroppers and they didn't need another mouth to feed, so he was raised working for white folks, but like a slave, not like a child." This shows that just because he was poor, he was treated badly. According to "Asaparagus" it says, "Miguel, Do you not understand? You are still a second class citizen..." This explains that they are second class citizens just because they are poor. America used to treat people unfairly because of their race, and it they were poor.

America was not a place of fairness and opportunity because they treated people unfairly for despicable reasons. Just like how they weren't treated fairly because they were Mexican. They also weren't treated fairly because they were poor. Now don't you think some people were treated unfairly back then?
