 FAQ:
How does this site work?
This site works by taking a vote amongst the greatest oracles of all time: Pythia (Oracle at Delphi), Nostradamus, and Taylor, our resident expert who knows everything because of his love for green herbs. Clearly, this is the most fair and balanced system of all time.
Is it really just a random 50/50 chance?
Well, we like to think it's more than just a simple 50/50 coin flip. We prefer to call it a complex system of quantum randomness that only the smartest and most enlightened among us could comprehend. But, sure, it's just a random 50/50 chance.
Are the results real?
Oh, absolutely! These results are as real as Taylor's knowledge of the universe after a long day of... studying.
How should the results be interpreted?
The results should not be interpreted in any meaningful way and cannot be generalized. They are simply for entertainment purposes, like a magic 8 ball or reading your fortune from a cookie.
Why does the website look like shit?
Well, we couldn't find a human web designer who was available, so we had to resort to using AI. Let's just say that AI has yet to master the art of website design and the result is, well, less than ideal.
Were the texts chosen unfairly?
It depends on what you mean by "unfair." If you mean were they chosen in a way that pits them against the detectors, then yes, they were chosen unfairly. This adversarial behavior is exactly what students attempting to cheat or bad actors attempting to generate inauthentic content would do. But, hey, life is all about pitting yourself against the detectors, right?
