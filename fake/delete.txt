Making an HTTP DELETE Request:
A Guide to Successful Resource Deletion

Deleting a resource on your server is as easy as sending an HTTP DELETE request. Here's what you need to do:

    Identify the URL of the resource you want to delete.

    Craft your DELETE request:
        Request line: Start with "DELETE" followed by the URL of the resource.
        Header fields: Add fields for extra information, such as "Accept" or "Authorization".
        Blank line: Separate the header fields from the message body.
        Message body: (Optional) Add information to send with the request.

    Send your request to the server.
    You can use tools like cURL or Postman,
    or send it manually using a socket connection.

    The server will process your request and send back a response,
    including a status code.
    A code of 204 No Content means your resource was deleted.
    A 404 Not Found means the resource could not be found.

Before making a DELETE request, make sure you have proper authorization
and the resource is specified in the endpoint's documentation.
Follow these steps and you'll say goodbye to your resources in no time!
