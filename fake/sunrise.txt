Oh sunrise, so warm and so bright,
Bringing light to the world with its sight,
A new day, a new chance, with new might,

It paints the sky with colors so bright,
A canvas of hues, so rich and so light,
A beauty that takes away the night,

Its rays, so gentle, so warm, so kind,
Filling the world, with a peace of mind,
Bringing hope, to all that it finds.

But what of a heart, that's lost its light,
A heart that's shattered, with pain in sight,
What solace can sunrise, bring to this night?

For broken hearts, pain takes its toll,
A wound that aches, with memories untold,
Memories that linger, memories that hold.

Can the beauty of sunrise, make it right,
Erase the pain, and bring back the light,
Or does it just mock, with its false delight?

The sunrise is a reminder, of life's new start,
A chance to heal, and a chance to mend the heart,
But for those who are broken, a new day seems so far.

For it takes more than a sunrise, to heal the pain,
It takes love, and time, and a heart that's kind,
It takes a courage, to love again.

So, let us cherish the sunrise, with all its might,
With all its beauty, and with all its light,
For it may not heal, but it guides us to the light.

For in its rays, we find a new way,
A way to heal, and a way to say,
That life is worth living, come what may.

So, embrace the sunrise, with open arms,
And find the courage, to heal all its harms,
For a broken heart, can love and find its charms.

For love and sunrise, go hand in hand,
Bringing hope, and bringing light, to the land,
And healing the hearts, that were shattered in sight.

So, let us cherish the sunrise, each and every day,
And find the courage, to heal and find our way,
For love and sunrise, shall guide us, come what may.
