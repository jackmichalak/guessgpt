I still hear your voice
Still feel your touch, by my side
Reason I wake up each day
You're my everything, better half

Said goodbye, pain still lingers
Find my way back, end of time, love still triggers

[Rap Section]
Miss you more every day
Crying tears, feeling pain
Gonna find my way back
Love you more, that's a fact
